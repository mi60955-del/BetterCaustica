# Developer Guide

## Windows

1. Install the Vulkan SDK from <https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home>.
   The installer sets `VULKAN_SDK` automatically.
2. Download the DLSS SDK from <https://github.com/NVIDIA/DLSS/releases>.
   Extract it, then set `DLSS_SDK` to the folder you extracted.

   To set it permanently for your Windows user account, run PowerShell with:

   ```powershell
   [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("DLSS_SDK", "C:\path\to\dlss-sdk", "User")
   ```

   Restart your terminal after setting it. To set it only for the current
   PowerShell session, use:

   ```powershell
   $env:DLSS_SDK = "C:\path\to\dlss-sdk"
   ```

3. Configure and build the native shim:

```powershell
cmake -S native/ngx_shim -B build/cmake/ngx_shim/release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build/cmake/ngx_shim/release --config Release
```

4. Run the client:

```powershell
$env:JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS = "-Xmx8G -XX:+UseCompactObjectHeaders -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch -XX:+UseStringDeduplication -XX:+UseZGC"
.\gradlew.bat runClient --args="--renderDebugLabels --graphicsBackend VULKAN"
```

## Linux

Set `DLSS_SDK` and `VULKAN_SDK` before configuring CMake:

```bash
export DLSS_SDK=/path/to/dlss-sdk
export VULKAN_SDK=/path/to/vulkan-sdk
```

`DLSS_SDK` must contain the NGX headers and static library. `VULKAN_SDK` must
contain Vulkan headers.

Then configure and build the native shim:

```bash
cmake -S native/ngx_shim -B build/cmake/ngx_shim/release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build/cmake/ngx_shim/release
```

On NixOS, enter the development shell from `flake.nix` instead of setting up
the toolchain by hand:

```bash
nix develop
cmake -S native/ngx_shim -B build/cmake/ngx_shim/release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build/cmake/ngx_shim/release
```

## FSR frame generation

BetterCaustica can generate frames with AMD FidelityFX as well as with DLSS. That
path needs its own native shim, and Gradle bundles it only when `FFX_SDK` points
at a FidelityFX SDK checkout:

```powershell
$env:FFX_SDK = "C:\path\to\ffx-vk-spike"
.\native\_dev_build_ffx.bat shim
.\gradlew.bat build
```

`_dev_build_ffx.bat` builds `build/native/ffx_shim/release/ffxshim.dll` with
CMake and MSVC, the same way step 3 builds the NGX shim. It defaults `FFX_SDK` to
`third_party\ffx-vk-spike` for its own compile, but the Gradle bundling step reads
the environment variable, so export it or `bundleFfxNatives` skips silently.
`bundleFfxNatives` then copies that shim plus `amd_fidelityfx_vk.dll` from the SDK
into the jar. A jar built without it still works and offers only the DLSS
frame-generation backends.

## Native Bundling

Gradle bundles NGX natives for the current host platform by default:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

Release builds that already have both platform shims available can request a
cross-platform native bundle:

```bash
./gradlew build -PngxPlatforms=windows-x64,linux-x64
```

Run the Vulkan RT/DLSS-RR client with:

```bash
JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS='-Xmx8G -XX:+UseCompactObjectHeaders -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch -XX:+UseStringDeduplication -XX:+UseZGC' nvidia-offload ./gradlew runClient --args='--renderDebugLabels --graphicsBackend VULKAN'
```
